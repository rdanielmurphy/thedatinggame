        <item name="Surface Deterioration" number="9">Repair: Surface deterioration (spalling, crumbling material) was observed on foundation walls. This condition is common in many old homes and does not usually represent a serious structural concern unless there is substantial loss of material. In an effort to prevent long term deterioration, it would be wise to consider parging (a concrete stucco-like coating) over deteriorated areas. Lot drainage improvements and elimination of water or roof runoff splashing against foundation walls as outlined in the Exterior section of this report are also recommended.</item>
        <item name="Basement Stairwell Added" number="10">Monitor: A basement stairwell appears to have been added. It is possible that measures were not taken to protect the footing of the house from frost damage. While no evidence of frost movement has appeared to date you should be alert for signs of damage in this area in the future.</item>
        <item name="Backfill Height Excessive" number="11">Repair: The height of the backfill (soil adjacent to the foundation) appears to be high enough to result in excessive force on the foundation. This could cause foundation damage. A structural engineer who is familiar with foundation design or qualified foundation repair contractor should be consulted to further evaluate this condition to suggest corrective measures.</item>
        <item name="Expansive Soil Heaving" number="12">Major Concern: The foundation shows evidence of cracking and heaving. Given the history of this area, it is likely that this condition is the result of expansive soil conditions. This can be a serious and costly structural problem. A structural engineer who is an expert regarding expansive soils should be consulted to further evaluate this condition and the remedies available.</item>
        <item name="Tree Proximity" number="13">Repair: The proximity of the tree could disrupt drainage pipes, cause mechanical damage to the exterior of the house, or affect the foundation over time. You should consider removal of the tree.</item>
        <item name="Piles And Mud Sill" number="14">Major Concern, Repair: The foundation uses wood piles supporting a wood sill beam. This arrangement is highly prone to rot and structural movement over time. The foundation in this area should be replaced. A structural engineer or qualified contractor specializing in this type of repair should be consulted to further evaluate this condition to suggest repair alternatives.</item>
        <item name="Basement Floor Lowered" number="15">Monitor: The basement floor appears to have been lowered. It is very important that the footing of the house is not undermined during this process. No evidence of serious structural movement was visible at the time of the inspection. You should be alert for cracking or other signs of foundation movement.</item>
        <item name="Basement Fl. Lowered Improperly" number="16">Major Concern, Possible Repair: The basement floor appears to have been lowered. It is very important that the footing of the house is not undermined during this process. The visible evidence suggests that proper procedure may not have been followed. Since improperly supported foundation walls can be seriously damaged by water, frost, or movement, he history of the changes to the basement should be investigated. A structural engineer familiar with foundation design and repair should also be engaged to review this situation.</item>

        <item name="Past/Seasonal Water" number="11">Past/Seasonal Water</item>
        <item name="Standing Water" number="12">Repair: Standing water was observed in the crawl space. Wet crawl spaces risk building damage from rot and insects and can cause interior mold or mildew. Roof and lot drainage repairs or improvements should be addressed as a first step to controlling water in the crawl space (see "Exterior"). This condition should then be monitored to determine if additional, measures are necessary.</item>

It may be the result of the materials, framing design, installation methods and aging of the building. There was not evidence of need for immediate, costly repair.</item>
        <item name="Sagging/Movement Typical" number="2">Sagging/Movement Typical</item>
        <item name="Minor Framing Flaws" number="3">Monitor: Liberties have been taken with good framing techniques. The inspection did not find evidence of significant damage to the structure nor need for immediate major repair. You should have repairs made when other structural or carpentry work is being done on the building.</item>
        <item name="Sills Not Anchored" number="4">Repair: The sills of the structure are not properly anchored where visible. Proper connectors to fasten the sills to the foundation should be installed to protect the building from movement and damage.</item>
        <item name="Sills Near Grade Level" number="5">Repair: The wood sills of the structure are at or near grade level. Foundation walls should extend at least six (6) inches above grade level so that wood structural members are protected from moisture and insect damage. Where insufficient clearance exists, grade level should be lowered, treated wood used, or an effective moisture barrier should be provided. During these improvements, further investigation of the wood sills should be undertaken as there is risk of hidden damage.</item>
        <item name="Sills Below Grade - Rot" number="6">Major Concern, Repair: The wood sills of the structure are below grade level. This condition invites rot and insect damage. Foundation walls should extend at least six (6) inches above grade level so that the floor and wall structure are protected from moisture. Where the sills are below grade, the grade level should be lowered, the foundation should be extended, treated wood used, or an effective moisture barrier should be provided. During these improvements, further investigation of the wood sills should be undertaken since there is extra risk of potentially costly hidden damage.</item>
        <item name="Joist Cracking" number="7">Monitor: Floor joists are cracked. Cracked joists are repaired by replacement, "sister" joists along side, or additional support. Where one or very few damaged joists are found, this work is not high priority and can be combined with other structural or carpentry repairs at the property.</item>
        <item name="Joist Notches/Cut" number="8">Joist Notches/Cut</item>
        <item name="Joist End Bearing" number="9">Repair: The floor joists have insufficient end bearing. Additional support is needed to reduce risk of structural movement and damage.</item>
        <item name="Joist Span" number="10">Monitor: The span of the floor joists appears to exceed common framing practice. While this does not pose a serious short term problem, expect "bouncy floors" and possibly excessive floor sagging over time. Additional support may be needed.</item>
        <item name="Stairwell Floor Movement" number="11">Monitor: The floor structure in the vicinity of the stairwell has moved. This is typically the result of poor framing connections, missing post(s), or missing/undersized framing members (header and trimmer joist) around the stair opening. This condition is common in old homes. Poor joist connections can be improved by the provision of joist hangers. Undersized header and trimmer joists can be enlarged, or re-supported by a post at the corner of the stairwell opening in the basement. In the absence of signs of ongoing movement these improvements are low priority and can be combined with other carpentry or structural repairs.</item>
        <item name="Beam Cracking" number="12">Repair: A beam is cracked. Further cracking or movement risks serious structural movement and damage. Re-supporting this beam is recommended.</item>
        <item name="Beam Notches" number="13">Repair: A beam is notched. This condition risks structural movement and damage. Re-supporting this beam is recommended.</item>
        <item name="Beam End Bearing" number="14">Repair: A beam has insufficient end bearing. Additional support is needed to reduce risk of structural movement and damage.</item>
        <item name="Beam Span" number="15">Monitor: The span of the beam appears to exceed common practice. While this does not pose a serious short term problem, it may allow for excessive sagging of the beam over time. Additional support may be needed.</item>
        <item name="Rot Minor" number="16">Repair: The floor structure shows evidence of minor rot. Rot weakens the structure and causes distress to the building. Damaged wood should be repaired or replaced and the conditions that have promoted the rot (such as wet conditions and/or poor ventilation) should be remedied.</item>
        <item name="Rot Severe" number="17">Major Concern, Repair: The floor structure shows evidence of substantial rot. Rot weakens the structure and causes building damage. Rot develops where untreated wood is in contact with moisture and/or where wood/soil contact exists. Damaged wood should be repaired or replaced and the conditions that have promoted the rot should be corrected. A framing repair company or structural engineer who is expert in wood framing be consulted to further evaluate this condition and the remedies available.</item>
        <item name="Fire Damage Minor" number="18">Monitor: The floor structure shows evidence of minor fire damage. The extent of char on the visible fire damaged members does not appear to represent a serious problem. Other structural components concealed from view could be more (or less) seriously damaged depending on where the fire occurred. You should find out the history of this fire and the extent to which it involved the building since there could be additional hidden damage or improper repair work. The local fire department may have a record of what occurred.</item>
        <item name="Fire Damage Severe" number="19">Major Concern, Repair: The floor structure shows evidence of severe fire damage. The extent of char on the visible fire damaged members appears to have weakened these members so that they need to be replaced. The extent of visible damage suggests that further damage exists. You should find out the history of this fire and the extent to which it involved the building. The local fire department may have a record of what occurred. A structural engineer who is familiar with fire damage should be consulted to further evaluate this condition and to suggest repair alternatives.</item>
        <item name="Cantilever Rot" number="20">Major Concern, Repair: The floor joists that are cantilevered (extended beyond the foundation on the exterior of the home) to form a balcony or deck are rotted. This design risks rot extending to the portion of the joists serving the house interior floor as well. The cantilevered joists should be severed and the building wall sealed against water entry in order to protect the floor structure of the house. The deck should be re-supported or rebuilt using conventional methods.</item>
        <item name="Cantilever Potential Rot" number="21">Major Concern, Future Repair: The floor joists that are cantilevered (extended beyond the foundation on the exterior of the home) to form a balcony or deck, are prone to rot. This design risks rot extending to the portion of the joists serving the house interior floor as well. Eventually the cantilevered joists should be severed in order to protect the floor structure of the house, and. the deck should be re-supported or rebuilt using conventional methods.</item>
        <item name="Concrete Floor Cracks Severe" number="22">Repair: The concrete floor is severely cracked. Although this floor is not a structural component of the house, repair is desirable to reduce trip hazards and potential water or other damage. Repair might involve significant expense.</item>
        <item name="Wood/Soil Contact" number="23">Wood/Soil Contact</item>
        <item name="Mildew Visible" number="24">Repair: Mildew was found. This is usually due to improper ventilation. One (1) square foot of free vent area should be provided for every five hundred (500) square feet of crawl space. Proper ventilation helps control humidity and reduces the risk of rot. Crawl spaces can be vented to the building interior or exterior, depending on crawl space configuration.</item>

    <infobutton description="(n) Structure Observations EXTERIOR WALLS" number="159">
        <item name="Cracks Typical" number="1">Monitor: Common minor cracks were observed on the exterior walls of the house. This implies that structural movement has occurred. The location, size, shape of these cracks is common. The inspection did not find evidence of significant movement requiring immediate major repairs.</item>
        <item name="Cracks Moderate" number="2">Monitor: More extensive than common wall cracks were observed. Since additional movement could lead to need for repairs, this area should be monitored.</item>
        <item name="Cracks Major" number="3">Major Concern, Repair: Pronounced exterior wall cracks were observed. This implies that structural movement of the building has occurred. While the rate of movement cannot be predicted during a one-time inspection it is likely that repairs are needed. A structural engineer or a repair specialist who is familiar with residential building failures should be consulted to further evaluate this condition and the remedies available. Recommend a qualified contractor tuck point as needed.</item>
        <item name="Weep Holes Blocked" number="4">Repair: Blocked weep holes (openings in the mortar joints, typically found at foundation level) in the brick veneer wall structure should be cleared to reduce the risk of water and/or frost damage.</item>
        <item name="Brick Overhant Excess" number="5">Monitor: The overhang of the brick is excessive at the foundation. This could lead to instability of the brickwork. If movement occurs, additional support will be needed.</item>
        <item name="Lintel Movement/Cracks" number="6">Lintel Movement/Cracks</item>
        <item name="Bowing" number="7">Major Concern, Repair: Bowing of the exterior wall structure was observed. This implies that structural movement of the building has occurred. Since The rate of movement cannot be predicted during a one-time inspection, a structural engineer or masonry repair expert should be consulted to further evaluate this condition and the remedies available.</item>
        <item name="Leaning" number="8">Major Concern, Repair: The exterior wall structure is leaning. This implies that structural movement of the building has occurred. The rate of movement cannot be predicted during a one-time inspection. A structural engineer should be consulted to further evaluate this condition and the remedies available.</item>
        <item name="Chimney Movement" number="9">Repair, Monitor: The chimney shows evidence of pulling away from the wall structure of the house proper. Since chimney movement can damage the chimney's interior flue (an unsafe condition) you should have the chimney inspected by a chimney sweep. If chimney relining or chimney foundation repair is needed significant cost could be involved. If the amount of movement is minor, old, not-ongoing, and if the flue is not damaged, only monitoring is required.</item>

    <infobutton description="(n) Structure Observations ROOF" number="160">
        <item name="Ridge Sag" number="1">Monitor: The ridge of the roof appears to have minor sagging. This condition is common in many old homes. No corrective measures are necessary at present.</item>
        <item name="Rafter Sag" number="2">Monitor: The rafters of the roof structure show evidence of sagging. Strengthening the roof structure would resist further movement. This improvement is not priority unless the roof is likely to be subjected to heavy loads such as from snow or additional layers of roofing material whose weight could cause further damage. Additional support can often be added easily.</item>
        <item name="Collar Ties Insufficient" number="3">Repair: To resist additional rafter sagging, collar ties (horizontal members running between each rafter, near their mid-span) should be provided for all rafters.</item>
        <item name="Sheathing Unevenness (Truss)" number="4">Monitor: Some roof sheathing sags. This is common where prefabricated roof trusses are spaced two feet apart, allowing sagging between trusses. Additional support may be needed when re-roofing.</item>
        <item name="Truss Uplift" number="5">Monitor: Cracks at the interior wall and ceiling intersection indicates cosmetic ceiling damage from "truss uplift." This condition is common in homes employing prefabricated trusses in cold climates. When cosmetic repairs are made you can reduce future cracking by eliminating nails in the drywall at the ceiling close to walls where cracks occurred.</item>
        <item name="Truss Cut/Altered" number="6">Truss Cut/Altered</item>
        <item name="FBM Plywood" number="7">Monitor, Repair: It is suspected that FBM/FRT (Fire Retardant Treated) Plywood has been used as roof sheathing. This sheathing is prone to de-lamination and weakening. This roof sheathing should be carefully checked and monitored. Sections that begin to fail should be replaced no later then when re-roofing.</item>
        <item name="Sheathing Condensation" number="8">Monitor: Evidence of condensation was observed on the underside of the roof sheathing. This can weaken the sheathing and ultimately necessitate replacement. Improved roof and attic ventilation (see Insulation and Ventilation) can reduce condensation. During re-roofing, the sheathing should be investigated to determine if replacement is needed.</item>
        <item name="Sheathing delaminated" number="9">Repair: The roof sheathing is delaminating (deterioration caused by moisture). In most cases, damaged roof sheathing must be replaced prior to re-roofing. The area was dry at the time of the inspection, but due to the lack of recent rain we are unable to determine if the stain is still active. Recommend consulting with the current owners for additional information prior to closing. If the leak is still active, we recommend repair/replace as needed to remedy the leak.</item>
        <item name="Insulation Stains Noted" number="10">Monitor: Stains on the insulation were observed as evidence of prior roof leaks.</item>

    <infobutton description="(n) Structure Oservations WOOD BORING INSECTS" number="161">
        <item name="Termite Area" number="1">Monitor: This home is in an area known for wood destroying insect activity. Wood destroying insect can do a substantial amount of damage to the wood structural components of a home. Any form of wood/soil contact should be avoided. Controlling dampness in the soil around the perimeter of a home, including below porches and in crawl spaces, is recommended. Preventative chemical treatment, performed by a licensed pest control specialist, is also advisable.</item>
        <item name="Termite Activity" number="2">Monitor: Evidence of wood destroying insect activity was observed and there is risk of additional hidden damage. If the property has not already been treated, a licensed pest control specialist should be engaged. Wood destroying insect can do a substantial amount of damage to the wood structural components of a home.</item>
        <item name="Termite Damage" number="3">Repair: Evidence of wood destroying insect damage was observed and there is risk of additional hidden damage since termites can do a substantial amount of damage. If the property has not already been treated, a licensed pest control specialist should be engaged to eliminate further wood destroying insect activity within the home. Damaged wood should be repaired or replaced. Any wood soil contact should be eliminated.</item>

        <item name="Cottage Construction" number="5">The construction of the house is "cottage style." Many structural repairs and improvements are either needed or desirable. It is common to find cottages not built to current standards for durability and safety. While many of the observations made in this report suggest that serious conditions exist, it is possible that the house can be inhabited with short-term deferral of some major repair items. Many homes of this type are repaired only on an as-needed basis and extensive, proper repairs may have been postponed indefinitely. Some general examples not necessarily drawn from this building: when the foundation shifts, it is jacked and supported in makeshift fashion; when insects infest a section of the structure, treatment is performed and damaged wood is repaired or simply left in place. This deferred maintenance approach to maintaining a building is less costly in the short-run but requires a "cottage mentality." Unexpected repairs are an ongoing occurrence. At some point, the decision is made to either substantially improve the building, to rebuild it, or to replace it.</item>
        <item name="Very Old House Construction" number="6">As is typical of homes of this age, the building exhibits many unusual conditions. Many structural repairs and improvements are either needed or desirable. In practice, however, many homes of this type are improved only on an as needed basis. Many less than ideal conditions are simply tolerated. Old timbers, for example, may exhibit evidence of rot and prior insect damage. These timbers could be replaced. Many owners undertake these costly repairs only if the timber fails or is substantially weakened. In this report repairs will be recommended only where in the inspector's opinion they are critical.</item>

        <item name="Fair Cond. - Poor Workmnshp" number="6">Monitor: The roofing is in fair condition but has been installed using poor workmanship. While this condition does not pose a serious short term concern, it risks leaks and shorter roof life.</item>
        <item name="Fair Condition - Uneven Wear" number="7">Monitor: The roofing is in fair condition, with different areas wearing at different rates. The sides of the roof exposed to most sunlight wear more quickly than more shaded areas. Early repair or replacement may be needed in some areas prior to replacing the entire roof covering.</item>
        <item name="Fair Condition - Premature Flaws" number="8">Major Concern, Possible Repair: The roofing shows evidence of flaws. The wear rate on roofing material in this condition often accelerates and can lead to premature roof leaks and the need for extensive replacement. It's possible that a warranty claim may be possible if made by the present owner who had the roof installed. The roof should be examined by a roofing contractor and repair/replacement cost estimated.</item>
        <item name="Fair Cond. - Moss From Shade" number="9">Monitor: The roofing is in fair condition. The roofing shows evidence of moss and organic build up in shaded areas. This condition may reduce the life expectancy of the roofing. Trimming or removing trees could improve this condition.</item>

        <item name="Good Condition - Uneven Wear" number="11">Monitor: The roofing is in good condition. This roofing is wearing at uneven rates. The sides of the roof exposed to most sunlight wear more quickly than more shaded areas. Early repair or replacement may be needed in some areas prior to replacing the entire roof covering.</item>
        <item name="Inappropriate Mat. - Low Slope" number="12">Monitor: The roofing material used is not intended for this low slope application. While this condition does not pose a serious short term concern, you should expect a short roof life in this area. For longer life use a membrane-type roofing material such as EPDM or modified bitumen when re-roofing.</item>
        <item name="Older Roofs - Maintenance Notes" number="13">Monitor: Older roofs are, by their nature, a high maintenance roof. Annual inspection and repair should be anticipated. In addition, the older flashings should be monitored. In some cases, a deteriorated flashing can result in expensive repairs, because sections of the roofing have to be removed. As a rule of thumb, replacement of the entire roof covering may be logical if more than ten percent of the roof requires repair.</item>
        <item name="Wood Roof Maintenance Notes" number="14">Monitor: The life expectancy of wood roofs is generally twenty-five to forty years. This will depend on several factors such as the quality of shingle or shake, the slope of the roof (steeper is better), the amount of exposed shingle, and the amount of sun or shade. As with all roofs, annual maintenance is needed. Cracked, curled, or displaced shingles or shakes should be repaired. As a rule of thumb, replacement of the entire roof covering may be logical if more than ten percent of the wood roof requires repair.</item>
        <item name="Vulnerable Areas" number="15">Monitor: The design of the roofing system is such that several vulnerable areas exist. There is a higher potential for leaks. Annual inspections and ongoing maintenance will be critical.</item>

        <item name="Flat Roofs Vulnerable" number="2">It should be noted that flat roofs have a higher potential for leaks. Leaks can be difficult to repair, as the source of the leakage can be far removed from the water stain that shows up on the interior. Some roofers will insist on re-roofing rather than patching flat roofs.</item>
        <item name="Older Roof Typical" number="3">The roof coverings are old and are at or near the end of its useful life.</item>
        <item name="Roof Design Vulnerable" number="4">The design of the roofing system is such that several vulnerable areas exist. There is a higher potential for unanticipated repairs. Annual inspections and ongoing maintenance will be critical to the performance of the roofing system.</item>
        <item name="Tree Branch Trimming" number="5">Trim away tree branches close to the roof.</item>
        <item name="Ice Dam Potential" number="6">The configuration of the roofing system is susceptible to ice damming and related leaks. The potential for ice dams varies with the severity of the winter and depending on insulation and ventilation under the roof. Severe ice dams can result in leaks, typically near the eaves. Solutions include better attic insulation and ventilation, eave protection below the roof coverings, or as a stop-gap measure, the installation of heating cables on the roof.</item>
        <item name="Ice Dams Visible" number="7">Ice damming was observed on the roof.

        <item name="Inapp. Outlets And Connectors" number="1">Major Concern, Repair: Aluminum solid-conductor branch circuit wiring is a potential fire hazard. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (US CPSC) recommends that solid-conductor aluminum wiring should either be replaced with solid-copper conductor wiring throughout the building or every aluminum-wire connection should be "pigtailed to copper wires" using special connectors (AMP Corporation's COPALUM connectors) to ensure safe operation of these circuits. Because of the properties of aluminum (corrosion and arcing), aluminum wire connections can overheat sufficiently to ignite a fire without ever drawing enough current to trip a circuit breaker or blow a fuse. Upon proper installation using US CPSC-approved connectors the safety of the system will be improved to acceptable levels. Be especially wary of work by untrained electricians and equally wary of alternative repair products as there is ample field evidence and formal studies confirming that other products (such as CO/ALR receptacles or recently-marketed special purple twist-on wire connectors) do not perform reliably in the field. An improper repair can actually increase risk. See the Internet website http://www.inspect-ny.com/aluminum.htm for detailed information including the CPSC recommendations.</item>

This suggests moisture in the ducts, which can also be a health hazard or in termite-prone areas it presents an increased risk of insect damage. It is impossible to predict the condition of the ducts below the entire slab. It may ultimately become necessary to abandon these ducts in favor of another means of heat distribution.</item>
        <item name="Motorized Dampers Suspect" number="11">Monitor: Motorized dampers have been provided in the ductwork. These dampers are typically operated by thermostats in different areas of the home. The dampers open as the thermostats call for heat. Most motorized damper systems are neglected over time and eventually break down. They are often abandoned. Some of these dampers may not be working and may in fact be obstructing air flow.

    <infobutton description="(n) Heating Observations BOILER" number="247">
        <item name="Normal Life" number="1">The boiler for this unit appears to be in working condition and within its expected life span. Actual equipment life will vary depending on quality of equipment and quality/frequency of service.</item>
        <item name="Near End Of Life" number="2">Monitor: Based on its age, the boiler may be near the end of its useful life. Budget for a new boiler; this is a significant expense.</item>
        <item name="Replace Soon" number="3">Repair: Based on its age, boiler replacement should be expected soon. Budget for a new boiler; this is a significant expense.</item>
        <item name="Old Boiler - Loss Of Efficiency" number="4">Monitor: Old boilers tend to be less efficient than newer units. While replacement of the boiler would result in lower heating costs, replacement is often not cost justified if the present unit is reliable and if after cleaning and adjustment its efficiency is 74% or better.</item>
        <item name="Prior Leak" number="5">Monitor: The boiler shows evidence of prior leakage. Watch for and repair any leaks promptly as prolonged leakage can damage the boiler.</item>
        <item name="Asbestos Covering?" number="6">Monitor: Insulation on the boiler and/or distribution piping may contain asbestos. The Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.) reports that asbestos represents a health hazard if "friable" (damaged, crumbling, or in any state that allows the release of fibers). If replacement of the boiler necessitates the removal of the asbestos containing insulation, an asbestos removal specialist should be engaged. If any sections of this insulation are indeed friable, or become friable over time, a specialist should also be engaged. Further guidance is available from the Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.). There may be other materials within the home that contain asbestos but are not identified by this inspection report.</item>
        <item name="One Pipe Steam" number="7">Possible Major Concern, Monitor: Heat is distributed by "one pipe" steam system. In this early design a single pipe both delivers steam to the radiators and returns condensate to the boiler. Heating pipe routing and placement is important and should not be modified without consulting a steam expert. If you are not satisfied with heat distribution in the building, a one-pipe system cannot be converted to forced hot-water without complete re-plumbing of the piping, a significant cost. You should defer such changes until you have experience with this particular system.</item>
        <item name="Two Pipe Steam" number="8">Possible Major Concern, Monitor: Heat is distributed by a "two pipe" steam system. In this design one pipe delivers heat (steam) to each radiator and a separate pipe carries condensate from the radiator back to the boiler. Finicky steam vents at radiators or other improper system adjustments can be corrected by a service technician who is trained on steam equipment. Often these systems are converted to forced hot water, resulting in easier distribution of heat to each area. As significant cost can be involved you should defer such changes until you have experience with this particular system.</item>
        <item name="Servicing Needed" number="9">Repair: The heating system requires service. This should be a regular maintenance item to assure safe, reliable heat.</item>
        <item name="Pump Inoperative" number="10">Repair: The circulating pump is inoperative.</item>
        <item name="PR Valve Needed" number="11">Repair, Safety Issue: A pressure relief valve could not be found on the heating system. This situation should be investigated further immediately, as it represents a safety concern. Some old steam and hot water heating systems vent excess pressure through an attic expansion tank directly to outdoors or to a plumbing drain. If this arrangement is found at this property we still recommend as a safety improvement the installation of a pressure/temperature relief valve right at the boiler.</item>
        <item name="Expansion Tank Waterlogged" number="12">Repair: Evidence suggests that the expansion tank serving the hot water heating systems is waterlogged. Repair this item as part of system service to assure proper system operation.</item>

        <item name="Deposits" number="6">Improve: There was a noticeable quantity of deposits visible in the gas furnace. This is a residue from the reaction of gas combustion and galvanized steel. These deposits are not unusual but can be an indication of lack of periodic cleaning and maintenance.</item>
        <item name="Flashback" number="7">Repair, Safety Issue: The heating system shows evidence of "flashback" (ignited gas spilling out at the front of the furnace at start up). This condition should be evaluated by a qualified licensed heating technician.</item>
        <item name="Pilot Problems?" number="8">Monitor: Evidence suggests that problems have been experienced in the past with the pilot light. If problems recur the heating system would be unreliable; repair is not usually a significant expense.</item>
        <item name="Underground Oil Tank" number="9">Major Concern, Repair: It is suspected that an underground oil storage tank exists on the property. If the tank has leaked you could face a costly environmental cleanup task since the US EPA has indicated that leaky residential oil tanks are an environmental hazard for which Federal spill cleanup regulations could apply. Buried tanks which have not leaked can be opened, cleaned, and filled in-place or they can be removed entirely. Before purchasing the property you should have the tank or soil tested to assure that no leaks have occurred. If the tank is to continue in use it may be possible to purchase tank leak cleanup insurance, possibly through your oil company. Tank replacement with a newer (fiberglass) leak-resistant type or tank relocation indoors will also involve a significant expense.</item>
        <item name="Oil Tank Leak" number="10">Possible Major Concern, repair, Safety Issue: The oil tank shows evidence of leakage. Oil leak cleanup, if extensive, could be costly. If the leak is in the tank itself (as opposed to a repairable fitting or pipe) then it needs to be replaced. Tank replacement involves significant expense.</item>
        <item name="Back Drafting" number="11">Repair, Safety Issue: The heating system shows evidence that exhaust products have been "back drafting". This is a safety concern. This condition results from any of a number of improper and potentially unsafe system conditions. Immediate repair by a qualified service technician is needed.</item>
        <item name="Flue Connections" number="12">Repair, Safety Issue: Poor exhaust flue connections should be improved immediately. Poor connections risk flue gas and carbon monoxide leakage or other unsafe conditions.</item>
        <item name="Vent Material Inappropriate" number="13">Repair, Safety Issue: The exhaust vent material appears to be inappropriate to this application. This condition should be evaluated by a qualified licensed heating technician.</item>
        <item name="Flue Slope" number="14">Repair, Safety Issue: The slope of the exhaust flue does not appear to be sufficient to allow the safe flow of exhaust gases. This condition should be repaired by a qualified heating technician.</item>
        <item name="Flue Clearance" number="15">Repair, Safety Issue: There is insufficient clearance between the exhaust flue and combustible materials. This is a fire hazard. This condition should be corrected by a qualified heating technician.</item>
        <item name="Induced Draft Fan Suspect" number="16">Monitor, Safety Issue: the draft-inducer fan serving the heating system is in suspect condition. If the draft-inducer fails the heating system may not operate properly and it could be unsafe. Have the unit checked by your heating technician promptly.</item>
        <item name="Barometric Damper Improvement" number="17">Repair: The barometric damper (draft regulator) on the exhaust flue is stuck or jammed and needs to be repaired to assure both system operating economy and safe venting of combustion gases.</item>
        <item name="Primary Control Suspect" number="18">Repair: The primary control serving the oil fired furnace should be evaluated for safe operation. A qualified licensed heating technician should be consulted.</item>
    </infobutton>
    <infobutton description="(n) Heating Observations FURNACE CHIMNEY" number="250">
        <item name="Liner Needed For Gas" number="1">Major Concern, Safety Issue: The chimney serving the gas fired heating system does not appear to be lined. Unlined flues risk unsafe system operation, blockage, gas leaks, or fire. Have the chimney inspected and lined (if necessary) by a guild-certified chimney sweep. (National Chimney Sweeps Guild.)</item>
        <item name="B-Vent Clearance" number="2">Repair, Safety Issue: The "B-Vent" metal chimney does not appear to be sufficiently clear from combustible materials. This situation should be repaired for fire safety.</item>
        <item name="Clean Out Needed" number="3">Monitor, Safety Issue: Chimneys without a cleanout door may in some circumstances be at higher risk of blockage - an unsafe condition. If possible, a "clean out" door should be installed below the exhaust flue for the heating system. Alternatively, the exhaust flue can be removed to check for debris in the chimney. This inspection and cleaning be performed by service personnel on first taking possession of the property and annually at service time.</item>
        <item name="Clean Out Dirty" number="4">Repair: Debris in the "clean out" area at the base of the chimney should be removed as part of system service.</item>

Like all heating systems, there are advantages and disadvantages, perceived comfort versus difficulty of repair versus operating cost. Electric radiant heat that malfunctions can be difficult to repair. When problems develop, the radiant system is often abandoned in favor of baseboard heaters. Cracks in the interior finish are also common with radiant heating. In many localities electric heat is a more expensive form of heat than gas or oil. However, it may be argued that better heat control is permitted because individual rooms are controlled by their own thermostat. Heating costs may also be offset slightly by lower regular maintenance costs. Converting the heating system will involve significant expense and should be deferred so long as the present system is working.</item>
        <item name="Water Heater Recovery Unit" number="7">The heating system employs a heat recovery unit for the purpose of supplying hot water to the domestic plumbing supply. These systems are relatively uncommon. If problems are experienced, these systems can usually be replaced with a conventional water heater.

Initially thought to be a health hazard, subsequent research did not bear out this concern. It was discovered that formaldehyde, if present due to the UFFI, outgassed almost completely after 2-6 years. However, people with extreme environmental sensitivities may continue to view this material with concern. If the building is tested for formaldehyde, be aware that the gas can occur from carpet padding, furniture foam, particleboard, and other new building materials. An evaluation of the impact of environmental issues on health or property value is beyond the scope of this inspection.</item>

        <item name="Typical Low Insulation Levels" number="1">As is typical of homes of this age and construction, insulation levels are relatively modest.</item>
        <item name="Insulation Improve. Subjective" number="2">Upgrading insulation levels in a home is an improvement rather than a necessary repair.</item>
        <item name="Worth Improving Older Home?" number="3">Most old homes have relatively low levels of insulation. The down side, of course, is that heating and/or cooling costs are higher. The up side is that these homes tend to be fairly well ventilated. Their natural ability to allow infiltration of outside air actually improves indoor air quality. Improving insulation levels will reduce energy costs; however, the potential benefit should we carefully weighed against the cost of improvements.</item>
        <item name="Investigate Insul. when re-roof" number="4">During any planned re-roofing, overhead insulation and ventilation levels should be investigated and improved where necessary.</item>
        <item name="Importance Of Caulking Etc." number="5">Caulking and weather-stripping around doors, windows and other exterior wall openings will help to maintain weather tightness and reduce energy costs.</item>

    <infobutton description="(n) Interior Observations BASEMENT LEAKAGE" number="331">
        <item name="No Visible Moisture" number="1">Monitor: No evidence of moisture penetration was visible in the basement at the time of the inspection. It should be understood that it is impossible to predict whether moisture penetration will pose a problem in the future. The vast majority of basement leakage problems are the result of insufficient control of storm water at the surface. The ground around the house should be sloped to encourage water to flow away from the foundation. Gutters and downspouts should act to collect roof water and drain the water at least five (5) feet from the foundation or into a functional storm sewer. Downspouts that are clogged or broken below grade level, or that discharge too close to the foundation are the most common source of basement leakage. Please refer to the Roofing and Exterior sections of the report for more information. In the event that basement leakage problems are experienced, lot and roof drainage improvements should be undertaken as a first step. Please beware of contractors who recommend expensive solutions. Excavation, damp-proofing and/or the installation of drainage tiles should be a last resort. In some cases, however, it is necessary. Your plans for using the basement may also influence the approach taken to curing any dampness that is experienced.</item>
        <item name="Typical Seepage" number="2">Monitor: The basement shows evidence of moisture penetration. It should be understood that it is impossible to predict the severity or frequency of moisture penetration on a one-time visit to a home. Virtually all basements exhibit signs of moisture penetration and virtually all basements will indeed leak at some point in time. The visible evidence is not unusual for a home of this age, construction and location. Further monitoring of the foundation will be required to determine what improvements, if any, will be required. Basement leakage rarely affects the structural integrity of a home. The vast majority of basement leakage problems are the result of insufficient control of storm water at the surface. The ground around the house should be sloped to encourage water to flow away from the foundations.

        <item name="Above Average Leakage" number="3">Monitor: The basement shows evidence of moisture penetration. It should be understood that it is impossible to predict the severity or frequency of moisture penetration on a one time visit to a home. Virtually all basements exhibit signs of moisture penetration and virtually all basements will indeed leak at some point in time. The visible evidence is above average for a home of this age, construction and location. Further monitoring of the foundations will be required to determine what improvements, if any, will be required. Basement leakage rarely affects the structural integrity of a home.

Your plans for using the basement may also influence the approach taken to curing any dampness that is experienced.</item>
        <item name="Chronic Leakage" number="4">Major Concern, Repair: The basement shows evidence of moisture penetration. While it is impossible to predict the severity or frequency of moisture penetration on a one time visit to a home, the visible evidence suggests that basement leakage will be a chronic occurrence. Further monitoring of the foundations will be required to determine what improvements will be required. The vast majority of basement leakage problems are the result of insufficient control of storm water at the surface. The ground around the house should be sloped to encourage water to flow away from the foundations. Gutters and downspouts should act to collect roof water and drain the water at least five (5) feet from the foundation, or into a functional storm sewer. Downspouts that are clogged or broken below grade level, or that discharge too close to the foundation, are the most common source of basement leakage. Please refer to the Roofing and Exterior sections of the report for more information. In the event that chronic basement leakage problems are experienced, excavation, damp-proofing and/or the installation of drainage tiles may be necessary. Your plans for using the basement may also influence the approach taken to curing any leakage that is experienced. Basement leakage rarely affects the structural integrity of a home. If the leakage can be tolerated, expensive repairs can usually be avoided.</item>
        <item name="Foundation Cracks" number="5">Monitor: It is very common for shrinkage and/or settling cracks to develop in foundation walls. It is also common for these cracks to leak. If leakage is experienced, improve lot drainage adjacent to the crack. If leakage persists, various methods of crack repair are available. These include interior patching with an epoxy resin or hydraulic cement and exterior repairs after excavation. The exterior repair, although more expensive, is more often successful in eliminating leakage.</item>
        <item name="Clogged Drainage Tile?" number="6">Monitor: Basement leakage problems can sometimes develop as a result of damaged, congested or ineffective perimeter foundation drainage tiles (often referred to as "weeping tiles"). It is impossible to predict the condition of drainage tiles during a visual inspection of the basement.</item>
        <item name="Sump Pump Unit" number="7">Monitor: Proper performance of the sump pump is critical to preventing basement leakage. Sump pumps usually serve to discharge storm water from the perimeter foundation drainage tiles. If the sump pump becomes inoperative, or if the discharge line is broken, damaged or improperly sloped, basement leakage can result. The operation of the sump pump should be carefully monitored. If the sump pump operates regularly, it may be prudent to consider a back up pump, or a battery power supply in the event of a power interruption. Please refer to the "Plumbing" section, where there may be more information on the sump pump. (Note: It is usually not possible to verify the discharge location of the sump pump line during an inspection.)</item>
        <item name="Ground Water?" number="8">Monitor: Depending on the location of the house, ground water tables can sometimes influence basement leakage. Ground water levels tend to fluctuate seasonally and during heavy rainfall. It is impossible to predict what influence ground water may have, during a one-time inspection of a home. If ground water levels extend above the height of the basement floor, the performance of the perimeter foundation drainage tile is very important. If ground water fluctuation causes basement leakage, the installation of effective drainage tiles (and sump pumps, in some cases) becomes necessary.</item>
        <item name="Old Houses Usually Leak!" number="9">Monitor: For owners of many old homes, basement leakage is a way of life. During rainy periods, or during the spring thaw, leakage is experienced. As basement leakage rarely influences the structural integrity of a home, and because basements of old homes usually remain unfinished, this condition is simply tolerated. Some precautions are, of course, taken to avoid damage to storage and personal belongings.</item>

        <item name="Asbestos In Ceiling Texture?" number="2">Monitor: Based on the age of this home, there is a possibility the ceiling texture may contain some asbestos. This can only be verified by laboratory analysis which is beyond the scope of this inspection. The Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.) reports that asbestos represents a health hazard if "friable" (damaged, crumbling, or in any state that allows the release of fibers). If any sections of the ceiling are indeed friable, or become friable over time, a specialist should be engaged. Further guidance is available from the Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.). Due to the age of construction, there may be other materials within the home that contain asbestos but are not identified by this inspection report.</item>
        <item name="Lead In Water Note" number="3">Monitor: There is the potential for lead content in the drinking water within the home. Lead in water may have two sources; the piping system of the utility delivering water to the house and/or the sold used on copper pipes prior to 1988. This can only be confirmed by laboratory analysis. An evaluation of lead in water is beyond the scope of this inspection. For more information, consult the Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.) for further guidance and a list of testing labs in your area.</item>
        <item name="Lead In Paint Note" number="4">Monitor: Lead based paint was in use until approximately 1978. According to the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, a lead hazard can be present in a house of this age. This can only be confirmed by laboratory analysis. An evaluation of lead in paint is beyond the scope of this inspection. For more information, consult the Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.) for further guidance and a list of testing labs in your area.</item>
        <item name="Radon Note" number="5">Monitor: Radon gas is a naturally occurring gas that is invisible, odorless and tasteless. A danger exists when the gas percolates through the ground and enters a tightly enclosed structure (such as a home). Long term exposure to high levels of radon gas can cause cancer. The Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.) states that a radon reading of more than 4.0 picocuries per liter of air represents a health hazard. A radon evaluation is beyond the scope of this inspection (unless specifically requested). For more information, consult the Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.) for further guidance and a list of testing labs in your area.</item>
        <item name="Carbon Monoxide Note" number="6">Monitor: It would be wise to install of carbon monoxide detectors within the home. Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that can result from a faulty fuel burning furnace, range, water heater, space heater or wood stove. Proper maintenance of these appliances is the best way to reduce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. For more information, consult the Consumer Product Safety Commission at 1-800-638-2772 (C.P.S.C.) or http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/5010.html for further guidance.</item>

        <item name="Older Home - Plaster Weakening" number="5">As is the case in many old homes, the plaster finishes show signs of weakening. Over time, the plaster begins to bulge as it looses its bond to the wall. While this poses no short term concern, it may become necessary to substantially improve or replace sections of plaster, particularly during redecorating. Where wallpaper is employed, the wallpaper often serves to hold the old plaster in place. When stripping wallpaper, the plaster sometimes weakens as the wallpaper is removed. This explains why many people wallpaper or paint over existing wallpaper. It should be noted that special fabrics exist that can be applied over weakened plaster, much like wallpaper, to reinforce the plaster prior to painting or wallpapering. This is far more cost effective than replacing plaster.</item>

        <item name="Cracks Minor/Settling" number="1">Common minor cracks were observed in the foundation walls of the house. This implies that some structural movement of the building has occurred, as is typical of most houses. New Item Need to be redefined</item>
        <item name="Cracks Minor/Shrinkage" number="2">Minor vertical cracking was observed in the foundation. This type of cracking is usually the result of shrinkage of the concrete as it cures. Shrinkage cracks are very common and should not be cause for alarm.</item>
        <item name="Cracks Moderate/Settling" number="3">Slightly greater than typical foundation cracking was observed. The amount of movement does not suggest a serious structural problem. This area should, of course, be monitored. The rate of movement cannot be predicted during a one-time inspection.</item>
        <item name="Cracks Major/Settling" number="4">Substantial foundation cracking was observed. This implies that structural movement of the building has occurred. The rate of movement cannot be predicted during a one-time inspection. A structural engineer should be consulted to further evaluate this condition and the remedies available for correction.</item>
        <item name="Spalling (Exterior)" number="5">Surface deterioration (known as spalling) was observed on the exterior of the exposed foundation walls. This condition is common in many homes and does not usually represent a structural concern. In an effort to prevent long term deterioration, it would be wise to consider parging deteriorated areas. Lot drainage improvements, as outlined in the "Exterior" section of this report are also recommended.</item>
        <item name="Mortar Deterioration (Exterior)" number="6">Foundation wall mortar joints show evidence of deterioration. It would be wise to consider repointing deteriorated areas in order to improve durability.</item>
        <item name="Backfill Height Excessive" number="7">The height of the backfill (soil adjacent to the foundation) appears to exceed the acceptable limit.

    <infobutton description="(tx) GRADING / DRAINAGE COMMENTS" number="405">
        <item name="Low Lot Relative To Neighbor" number="1">The lot is lower than adjacent lots. Grading improvements should be undertaken where possible. The general topography of the area is such that it will be difficult to control storm water entirely. During heavy rains or snow melts, the accumulation of storm water on the lot may be unavoidable. This could also influence moisture in the basement. Refer to the Interior section of the report for comments regarding evidence of basement moisture.</item>
        <item name="Grading Improvement Needed" number="2">The grading should be improved to promote the flow of storm water away from the house. This can usually be accomplished by the addition of top soil. The ground should slope away from the house at a rate of one inch per foot for at least the first ten feet. Ideally, at least eight (8) inches of clearance should be maintained between soil level and the top of the foundation walls.</item>
        <item name="Swale Improvement Bet. Houses" number="3">A drainage swale (if effect, a wide and shallow ditch) should be created. Drainage swales are intended to divert storm water away from the house and ultimately off the lot.</item>
        <item name="Driveway Slopes Towards House" number="4">The driveway appears to slope towards the house. This condition can promote moisture seepage. Unfortunately, it is difficult to improve this situation without resurfacing the driveway adjacent to the foundation.</item>
        <item name="Seal Driveway At House" number="5">The driveway should be sealed where it meets the house.</item>
        <item name="Walkway Slopes Towards House" number="6">The walkway appears to slope towards the house. This condition can promote moisture seepage. It is difficult to improve this situation without re-grading the walkway adjacent to the foundation.</item>
        <item name="Ravine Erosion Problem?" number="7">An evaluation of soil stability is beyond the scope of this inspection. As with many ravine lots, there is potential for erosion. If erosion problems are suspected, a soils engineer should be consulted to evaluate this condition and the remedies available for correction.</item>
        <item name="TREC Limitations I-B" number="8">TREC LIMITATIONS: The inspector is not required to inspect flatwork or detention/ retention pond (expect as related to slope and drainage); determine area hydrology or the presence or underground water; or determine the efficiency or operation of underground or surface drainage systems.</item>

    <infobutton description="(tx) ROOF STRUCTURE / ATTIC COMMENTS" number="407">
        <item name="Ridge Sag" number="1">The ridge of the roof appears to have sagged. This condition is common in many older homes. Strengthening the roof structure would resist further movement.</item>
        <item name="Rafter Sag" number="2">The rafters of the roof structure show evidence of sagging. Strengthening the roof structure would resist further movement.</item>
        <item name="Collar Ties Insufficient" number="3">Ideally, collar ties (horizontal members running between each rafter, near their mid-span) should be provided for all rafters. Collar ties help to resist rafter sag. Installation is usually very simple.</item>
        <item name="Sheathing Unevenness (Truss)" number="4">Some unevenness in the roof sheathing was observed. This condition is common where prefabricated roof trusses are used, and spaced two feet apart. The sheathing sags between the trusses.</item>
        <item name="Truss Uplift" number="5">As evidenced by cracking at the intersection of the interior wall and ceiling, the roof structure appears to suffer from "truss uplift". This condition is not uncommon in homes employing prefabricated trusses in colder climates. Truss uplift itself does not represent a serious structural concern. Cosmetic improvements on the interior of the home, such as the installation of a cove moulding secured to the ceiling, may be desirable to disguise interior cracks.</item>
        <item name="Truss Cut/Altered" number="6">The trusses of the roof structure appear to have been altered. Cutting or altering the chords of a truss can sacrifice the integrity of the truss. Special engineering considerations are usually required when trusses are altered. This area should be investigated and/or repaired.</item>
        <item name="FBM Plywood" number="7">It is suspected that FBM (Fire Retardant Treated) Plywood has been used as roof sheathing. This type of sheathing is prone to de-lamination and weakening. This roof sheathing should be carefully monitored. Sections that begin to fail should be replaced. During any re-roofing, sheathing improvements would be logical.</item>
        <item name="Sheathing Condensation" number="8">Evidence of condensation (in the form of mildew) was observed on the underside of the roof sheathing. This condition can weaken the sheathing and ultimately necessitate replacement. Improved roof and attic ventilation (see Insulation and Ventilation) typically control condensation. During any planned re-roofing, the sheathing should be investigated to determine if replacement is needed.</item>
        <item name="Sheathing Delaminated" number="9">The roof sheathing is de-laminating (deterioration caused by moisture). In most cases, damaged roof sheathing must be replaced prior to re-roofing. Improved roof and attic ventilation (see Insulation and Ventilation) typically control moisture levels within the roof structure. This condition should be further investigated when re-roofing.</item>

        <item name="Improve Ventilation" number="18">The level of ventilation should be improved. It is generally recommended that one (1) square foot of free vent area be provided for every one hundred and fifty (150) square feet of ceiling area. Proper ventilation will help to keep the house cooler during warm weather and extend the life of roofing materials. In colder climates, it will help reduce the potential for ice dams on the roof and condensation within the attic.</item>
        <item name="Marginal Ventilation" number="19">The level of ventilation is considered marginal. It is generally recommended that one (1) square foot of free vent area be provided for every one hundred and fifty (150) square feet of ceiling area. Proper ventilation will help to keep the house cooler during warm weather and extend the life of roofing materials. In colder climates, it will help reduce the potential for ice dams on the roof and condensation within the attic.</item>
        <item name="Soffit Vents Congested?" number="20">The passage of air between the soffit vents and the roof cavity appears to be obstructed. "Baffles" should be provided to hold back insulation and allow for free movement of air within the roof space. This area should be further investigated and improved where necessary.</item>
        <item name="Screens On Vents Needed" number="21">Roof vents should be screened to prevent insect and vermin entry.</item>
        <item name="Sloped Ceil. Questionable Vent." number="22">The ventilation of the sloped ceiling is questionable. Proper ventilation of cathedral roofs is rarely achieved. As a result, these areas tend to be prone to difficulty, particularly in colder climates. Ice damming on the roof and condensation within the roof space are common problems. These areas should be monitored.</item>
        <item name="Condensation/Mildew" number="23">Evidence of condensation and mildew was observed. This condition is usually the result of insufficient ventilation. Ventilation should be improved and this area should be monitored. If ignored, this situation could worsen and cause substantial rot.</item>

        <item name="Old Steel - Replacement" number="64">The old galvanized gutters and downspouts should be replaced.</item>
        <item name="Downspouts Insufficient Number" number="65">There does not appear to be a sufficient number of downspouts. If practical, additional downspouts should be installed to avoid spilling roof runoff around the building – a potential source of water entry or water damage.</item>
        <item name="Downspout Discharge Near House" number="66">The downspout(s) should discharge water at least five (5) feet from the house. Storm water should be encouraged to flow away from the building at the point of discharge.</item>
        <item name="Downspouts Clogged Below Grade?" number="67">The downspouts that discharge below grade level should be monitored. If they are ever suspected to be clogged or disconnected below grade, they should be redirected to discharge at least five (5) feet from the building. Foundation leakage adjacent to a downspout is an indication of a problem below grade.</item>
        <item name="Downspout Discharge Onto Roof" number="68">Downspout(s) that discharge onto the roof should be extended to discharge directly into the gutters below. This condition, if left unattended, can result in premature deterioration of the roofing under the end of the downspout.</item>

        <item name="Collar Ties Insufficient" number="72">Ideally, collar ties (horizontal members running between each rafter, near their mid-span) should be provided for all rafters. Collar ties help to resist rafter sag. Installation is usually very simple.</item>
        <item name="Sheathing Unevenness (Truss)" number="73">Some unevenness in the roof sheathing was observed. This condition is common where prefabricated roof trusses are used, and spaced two feet apart. The sheathing sags between the trusses.</item>
        <item name="Truss Uplift" number="74">As evidenced by cracking at the intersection of the interior wall and ceiling, the roof structure appears to suffer from "truss uplift". This condition is not uncommon in homes employing prefabricated trusses in colder climates. Truss uplift itself does not represent a serious structural concern. Cosmetic improvements on the interior of the home, such as the installation of a cove moulding secured to the ceiling, may be desirable to disguise interior cracks.</item>
        <item name="Truss Cut/Altered" number="75">The trusses of the roof structure appear to have been altered. Cutting or altering the chords of a truss can sacrifice the integrity of the truss. Special engineering considerations are usually required when trusses are altered. This area should be investigated and/or repaired.</item>
        <item name="FBM Plywood" number="76">It is suspected that FBM (Fire Retardant Treated) Plywood has been used as roof sheathing. This type of sheathing is prone to de-lamination and weakening. This roof sheathing should be carefully monitored. Sections that begin to fail should be replaced. During any re-roofing, sheathing improvements would be logical.</item>
        <item name="Sheathing Condensation" number="77">Evidence of condensation (in the form of mildew) was observed on the underside of the roof sheathing. This condition can weaken the sheathing and ultimately necessitate replacement. Improved roof and attic ventilation (see Insulation and Ventilation) typically control condensation. During any planned re-roofing, the sheathing should be investigated to determine if replacement is needed.</item>
        <item name="Sheathing Delaminated" number="78">The roof sheathing is de-laminating (deterioration caused by moisture). In most cases, damaged roof sheathing must be replaced prior to re-roofing. Improved roof and attic ventilation (see Insulation and Ventilation) typically control moisture levels within the roof structure. This condition should be further investigated when re-roofing.</item>
        <item name="Insulation Stains Noted" number="79">Stains on the insulation were observed as evidence of prior roof leakage.</item>

        <item name="Compressed Insulation" number="85">Compressed insulation should be rearranged.</item>
        <item name="Skylight Well Insulation Needed" number="86">The skylight well should be better insulated.</item>
        <item name="Improve Ventilation" number="87">The level of ventilation should be improved. It is generally recommended that one (1) square foot of free vent area be provided for every one hundred and fifty (150) square feet of ceiling area. Proper ventilation will help to keep the house cooler during warm weather and extend the life of roofing materials. In colder climates, it will help reduce the potential for ice dams on the roof and condensation within the attic.</item>
        <item name="Marginal Ventilation" number="88">The level of ventilation is considered marginal. It is generally recommended that one (1) square foot of free vent area be provided for every one hundred and fifty (150) square feet of ceiling area. Proper ventilation will help to keep the house cooler during warm weather and extend the life of roofing materials. In colder climates, it will help reduce the potential for ice dams on the roof and condensation within the attic.</item>
        <item name="Soffit Vents Congested?" number="89">The passage of air between the soffit vents and the roof cavity appears to be obstructed. "Baffles" should be provided to hold back insulation and allow for free movement of air within the roof space. This area should be further investigated and improved where necessary.</item>
        <item name="Screens On Vents Needed" number="90">Roof vents should be screened to prevent insect and vermin entry.</item>
        <item name="Sloped Ceil. Questionable Vent." number="91">The ventilation of the sloped ceiling is questionable. Proper ventilation of cathedral roofs is rarely achieved. As a result, these areas tend to be prone to difficulty, particularly in colder climates. Ice damming on the roof and condensation within the roof space are common problems. These areas should be monitored.</item>
        <item name="Condensation/Mildew" number="92">Evidence of condensation and mildew was observed. This condition is usually the result of insufficient ventilation. Ventilation should be improved and this area should be monitored. If ignored, this situation could worsen and cause substantial rot.</item>
        <item name="Power Ventilator Inoperative" number="93">The power ventilator appears to be inoperative. The unit should be repaired or replaced.</item>
        <item name="Access Hatch Needs Insulation" number="94">Ideally, the attic access hatch should be better insulated.</item>

        <item name="Cracks Minor/Settling" number="1">Common minor cracks were observed in the foundation walls of the house. This implies that some structural movement of the building has occurred, as is typical of most houses. New Item Need to be redefined</item>
        <item name="Cracks Minor/Shrinkage" number="2">Minor vertical cracking was observed in the foundation. This type of cracking is usually the result of shrinkage of the concrete as it cures. Shrinkage cracks are very common and should not be cause for alarm.</item>
        <item name="Cracks Moderate/Settling" number="3">Slightly greater than typical foundation cracking was observed. The amount of movement does not suggest a serious structural problem. This area should, of course, be monitored. The rate of movement cannot be predicted during a one-time inspection.</item>
        <item name="Cracks Major/Settling" number="4">Substantial foundation cracking was observed. This implies that structural movement of the building has occurred. The rate of movement cannot be predicted during a one-time inspection. A structural engineer should be consulted to further evaluate this condition and the remedies available for correction.</item>
        <item name="Spalling (Exterior)" number="5">Surface deterioration (known as spalling) was observed on the exterior of the exposed foundation walls. This condition is common in many homes and does not usually represent a structural concern. In an effort to prevent long term deterioration, it would be wise to consider parging deteriorated areas. Lot drainage improvements, as outlined in the "Exterior" section of this report are also recommended.</item>
        <item name="Mortar Deterioration (Exterior)" number="6">Foundation wall mortar joints show evidence of deterioration. It would be wise to consider repointing deteriorated areas in order to improve durability.</item>
